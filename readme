This is an implementation of Deep Neural Decision Forests in PyTorch.
I have only added the database loader for MNIST Dataset. 
Thanks to https://github.com/jingxil/Neural-Decision-Forests,
from where the base code was taken.
Also, the changes required due the change in PyTorch API have been made.
I have added Batch Normalisation Layers to analyse the change in performance.

Read my analysis of the papers and the summary of my work which
will aid in further understanding of the work.
