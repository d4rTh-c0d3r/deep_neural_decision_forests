This is an implementation of Deep Neural Decision Forests in PyTorch.
I have only added the database loader for MNIST Dataset. 
Thanks to https://github.com/jingxil/Neural-Decision-Forests,
from where the base code was taken.
Also, the changes required due the change in PyTorch API has been made.
I have added Batch Normalisation Layers to analyse the change in performance.
Read the summary which will aid in understanding of the paper.
